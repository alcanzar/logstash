# logstash

logstash is a tool for managing events and logs. You can use it to collect logs, parse them, and store them for later use (like, for searching). Speaking of searching, logstash comes with a web interface for searching and drilling into all of your logs.

It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning you
are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.

For more info, see <http://logstash.net/>

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome: ideas, patches, documentation, bug reports,
complaints, and even something you drew up on a napkin.

It is more important that you contribute than how you contribute. Ideas and
other things can come in the as a patch, a bug report, an emails, or over IRC.

That said, some basic guidelines:

* If you want to send patches, best way is to fork this repo and send me a pull
  request. I will also accept normal diff/patch patches over email.
* Found a bug? File it on [jira](https://logstash.jira.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa) 
  or send details to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/logstash-users)
* Have an idea or a specific feature request? Do the same as above.
