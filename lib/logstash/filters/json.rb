# This is a JSON parsing filter. It takes an existing field which contains JSON and
# expands it into an actual datastructure within the logstash event.
# 
# By default it will place the parsed JSON in the root of the logstash event, but this
# filter can be configured to place the JSON into any arbitrary event field, using the
# `target` configuration.

  # The configuration for the JSON filter:
  #
  #     source => source_field
  #
  # For example, if you have JSON data in the @message field:
  #
  #     filter {
  #       json {
  #         source => "message"
  #       }
  #     }
  #
  # The above would parse the json from the @message field
  config :source, :validate => :string, :required => true

  # Define the target field for placing the parsed data. If this setting is
  # ommitted, the JSON data will be stored at the root of the event.
  #
  # For example, if you want the data to be put in the 'doc' field:
  #
  #     filter {
  #       json {
  #         target => "doc"
  #       }
  #     }
  #
  # JSON in the value of the `source` field will be expanded into a
  # datastructure in the `target` field.
  #
  # NOTE: if the `target` field already exists, it will be overwritten!
  config :target, :validate => :string
